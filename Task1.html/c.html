            The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is 
            termed the front end. It is also referred to as the â€˜client side
            of the application. It includes everything that users experience 
            directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, 
            colors, and a navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages
            used for Front End development. Responsiveness and performance are the two
            main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site 
            is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of 
            the website should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.

            The backend is the server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, 
            and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine. 
            It is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the 
            portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. 
            The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly 
            accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs,
            creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or
            even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.
